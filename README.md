# Terraform Tutorials

A library of various cloud infrastructure configurations provisioned using HashiCorp's [Terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform).

## Hints and Recommendations

- If you are using Visual Studio Code, I highly recommend installing the Terraform extension. It will help greatly with syntax and formatting, and will be especially useful if you are not familiar with HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
